      "value": "<h3>Slowmind</h3>\n<p>I know that there are those who regard this plant as nothing more than a poison, but I have found it useful in extreme cases of nervous hysteria where the patient must be kept still to avoid self-inflicted injuries, and also in cases where the pain of a wound or infection makes it impossible for the patient to fall into a healing sleep. Provided the dosage is strictly controlled and the patient&rsquo;s temperature and breathing are constantly watched, I believe there is no significant risk. The root of this plant, which grows in marshy areas and is often found together with water-lilies, is first soaked in salt water for three days and nights to leach out any impurities, then dried on a pan in front of the fire for two days, or until it sounds woody when tapped with a fork. Then, it is finely grated &mdash; mixed with a little nutmeg if available &mdash; tied in a cloth bag and hung in the chimney to smoke for two weeks. The powder is then boiled for two days in water with a little vinegar, strained and added in small quantities to a sweet tea or mulled wine.</p>"
