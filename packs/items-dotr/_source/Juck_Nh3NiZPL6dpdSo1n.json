Growing in woodlands and flowering before the trees put on enough leaf to block sunlight from the forest floor, the sap of this plant can also be used to help restore feeling to the skin in cases of numbness caused by cold or injury. On one occasion, I used it in a concentrated form &mdash; boiled until it reached the consistency of hot custard &mdash; as a treatment for frostbite, and was able to restore feeling to a foot which otherwise might have had to be amputated. Because of the itching it causes, you may sometimes need to administer a mild sedative to the patient, especially if you use Juck repeatedly, or over a large area such as an entire leg.</p>"
