It also grows well in open marshy areas and beside streams whose banks are not too high. It is a very good sedative and sleeping-draught, and may combine with other preparations, with no fear of ill effects. The dried leaves are steeped in water which has boiled and been left to stand for a minute or so &mdash; if the water is boiling when the leaves are put in, they will scald and the resulting infusion will be unpleasantly bitter as well as less effective. The leaves can also be added to tea or mulled wine; a little honey will soften any sharpness that it adds to their flavour.</p>"
