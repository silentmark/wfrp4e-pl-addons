      "value": "<p>The Dwarf Engineers&rsquo; Guild and the Imperial Engineers&rsquo; School have both been developing steam engines, and one could be adapted to drive a boat. Of course, a steam engine is large and heavy, and will take up a considerable amount of space that could otherwise be devoted to cargo and/or passengers: about half of a boat&rsquo;s carrying capacity seems about right. This includes storage for enough coal to keep the boat running for a week, or enough wood to keep it running for two days.</p>\n<p>A boat powered by a steam engine can maintain its standard Movement rate for as long as the fuel holds out, regardless of wind direction. It requires tending by a qualified engineer, with <strong>Trade (Engineer) </strong>Tests made in place of <strong>Boat Handling</strong> Tests. Steam engines can be unreliable, though, and despite their size and bulk their mechanisms are easily upset. Whenever a double is rolled on a failed <strong>Trade (Engineer)</strong> Test, or the result is an Astounding Failure, or the boat takes a Critical Hull Hit, roll on the @Table[steam-engine] table</p>"
