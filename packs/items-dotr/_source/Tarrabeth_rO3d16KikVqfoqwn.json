There are few other names for the herb, although I have heard it called Emperor&rsquo;s Wort in some cities, often by Humans who came by the herb dishonestly and use a Human name in order to avoid the wrath of the authorities. For the best effect, the leaves should be boiled until they completely disintegrate; the mixture is then strained, boiled down to the consistency of melted cheese, and left to cool.</p>"
