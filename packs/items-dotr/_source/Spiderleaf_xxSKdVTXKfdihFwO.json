All across the Old World, it is known by the same name in the local language. There are even some healers &mdash; mostly Human &mdash; in remote areas who wrap the leaves in cobwebs before applying them to a wound, thinking that some magical sympathy between the spider-shaped plant and the webs of an&nbsp;actual spider will make the treatment more&nbsp;effective. It does not seem to do so.</p>"
