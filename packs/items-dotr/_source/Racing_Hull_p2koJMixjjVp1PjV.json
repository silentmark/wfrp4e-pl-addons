In an effort to outdo their fellows, some wealthy boat owners have sunk immense sums into research and craftsmanship, in search of the perfect hull shape for speed. A racing hull is as smooth as glass and cunningly shaped to reduce drag to a bare minimum, allowing the boat to travel at up to twice its normal Movement rate.</p><p>A boat with a racing hull is tricky to control, though, and requires a <strong>Difficult (−10) Boat Handling</strong> Test every hour. On a Marginal (−1 SL) or Normal Failure, Movement cannot exceed the normal rate; on an Impressive Failure (−4 SL), Movement is half normal; and on an Astounding Failure (−6 SL or less), the hull is damaged and the boat cannot exceed half normal Movement until it is repaired at a cost equal to half the cost of the hull, as above.</p><p>Normal @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dotr.journals.WR8ZAD6yw9lYgzeY.JournalEntryPage.qpdadmEFPBzFcklt]{repairs} to a racing hull cost twice the normal rate given, and require finer craftsmanship: all relevant Tests are one step more difficult than usual.</p><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>Encumbrance and Price reflects 10 ft. of length.
