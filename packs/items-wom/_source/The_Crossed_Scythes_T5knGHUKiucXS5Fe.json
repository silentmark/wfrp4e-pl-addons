This requires an <strong>Extended Challenging (+0) Art (Engraving)</strong> Test to a total of 20 SL. Beyond this portal there must be an Undead creature the Wizard seeks to suppress.</p><p><strong>Sacrifices</strong>: Each Round of Channelling the spellcaster must make an <strong>Average (+20) Cool</strong> Test or suffer 1 Damage which cannot be reduced by Toughness Bonus or Armour Points.</p><p><strong>Consequences</strong>: The ritual fails; the entity becomes aware of the effort to contain it.</p><p>Occasionally, an Amethyst Wizard will mark a tomb with a pair of overlaid and reversed Shyish runes. Only a fool would enter such a place, for this symbol warns of great evil slumbering within and acts as a ward against its escape. If an Amethyst Wizard seeks to create such a carving, they must be gifted at channelling <em>Shyish</em> and also deft with a hammer and chisel.</p><p>Once the symbol is carved and the ritual complete, any Undead creature without the Construct Trait that tries to cross the threshold must make a <strong>Very Difficult (–30)</strong> Cool Test to do so. If the creature fails the Test, they cannot pass the engraving and must take a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition for every –SL. They must do this even if they would not normally suffer <em>Fatigued</em> Conditions.</p><p>The creature could try to cross the threshold again the following turn, but would continue to accrue @Condition[Fatigued] Conditions until they pass the Cool Test. The creature can only recover from these <em>Fatigued</em> Conditions after a full night’s rest.</p><p>Undead creatures with the Construct Trait must make a <strong>Very Difficult (-30) Endurance</strong> Test. If the creature fails the Test, they cannot pass the engraving and suffer 1 Wound for every –SL.</p><p><strong>Lore:</strong> Targets afflicted by spells from the Lore of Death are drained of life, enervated, and listless. You may assign +1 @Condition[Fatigued] Condition to any living target affected by a spell from this lore. A target may only ever have a single Fatigued Condition gained in this manner at any one time.</p><p></p>"
