      "value": "<h3>The Goddess' Gift</h3>\n<p>Some herbalists in the Empire and Tilea believe that the name of this plant comes from the Human goddess Verena. I don&rsquo;t believe this myself, since it is also known by this name in Norsca and Kislev, where Ulric is far more commonly worshipped than Verena. It grows on the south side of chalk hills, where there is plenty of sun and not too much wind. The leaves are picked, cleaned, soaked in salt water for two weeks, and then boiled and served like spinach. A little butter and black pepper helps their flavour enormously. I personally don&rsquo;t use it for convalescents, because the headache that occurs when the herb wears off can often undo any good that the patient received from the herb&rsquo;s stimulant effect. However, I will prescribe it for those on watch, or required to search all night for missing travellers, or anyone else who needs to stay awake when they should be asleep, and who doesn&rsquo;t mind paying the price later.</p>"

It is most commonly used for convalescence, where the patient cannot rest for some reason. For [[/r 1d10]] hours after the dose is taken, the Character is treated as resting, but may undertake any kind of activity. If the Character rests, the benefits of rest are doubled. When the dose wears off, the user suffers a splitting headache, gaining one @Condition[Fatigued] Condition which lasts for an hour.</p>"
