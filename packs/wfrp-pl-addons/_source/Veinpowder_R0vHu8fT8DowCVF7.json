After imbibing a potion of Veinpowder, a Character may remove one Bleeding Condition at the end of each of their Rounds. This effect lasts for one hour, and is occasionally used by pit fighters and other professional brawlers in advance of a particularly challenging fight.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: serif\">Using Veinpowder in either form can be dangerous however. If a Character uses a second potion or unguent while already under the effects of an earlier dose of Veinpowder, they must make a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test or lose 1d10 Wounds and gain a Fatigued Condition, as their blood begins to thicken in their veins. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: serif\">A secondary, and far less well known use for Veinpowder potions is in battling Vampires and other Undead. The blood of those under the effect of Veinpowder provides no sustenance to Vampires and other creatures with the Vampiric Trait. These creatures do not heal any Wounds when biting victim who has recently consumed a potion of Veinpowder.</span></p>"
