Used by alchemists, wizards, smiths for engraving, and precision cutting in difficult to reach places by engineers, it is slow to lose its potency and users of it are rightfully wary, or swiftly lack a few fingers. A single flask’s worth can ‘eat through’ 8 Encumbrance of Equipment and causes a base +9 Damage, along with the Penetrating Quality and the Dangerous Flaw if employed as a crude weapon.</p><p>A 'Potion' of troll acid is really just the raw bile — the work goes into preparing a bottle of sufficient quality to hold the stuff. To use its 'raw' form one must either have a highly inconvenienced troll nearby, or have cut out its gallbladder or stomach to act as a container. If tavern tales are to believed this is a dangerous practice, as trolls are said to be able to regenerate from even a scrap of unburned flesh.</p><div><p></p></div></div></div><div><div><p></p></div><div><p><br></p></div></div>"
