      "value": "<h3>Slowmind</h3>\n<p>I know that there are those who regard this plant as nothing more than a poison, but I have found it useful in extreme cases of nervous hysteria where the patient must be kept still to avoid self-inflicted injuries, and also in cases where the pain of a wound or infection makes it impossible for the patient to fall into a healing sleep. Provided the dosage is strictly controlled and the patient&rsquo;s temperature and breathing are constantly watched, I believe there is no significant risk. The root of this plant, which grows in marshy areas and is often found together with water-lilies, is first soaked in salt water for three days and nights to leach out any impurities, then dried on a pan in front of the fire for two days, or until it sounds woody when tapped with a fork. Then, it is finely grated &mdash; mixed with a little nutmeg if available &mdash; tied in a cloth bag and hung in the chimney to smoke for two weeks. The powder is then boiled for two days in water with a little vinegar, strained and added in small quantities to a sweet tea or mulled wine.</p>"

The infusion has a bitter taste, and if added to a drink, a Character may detect that something is amiss with a <strong>Difficult (&ndash;10) Perception</strong> Test. A Character who drinks an infusion of Slowmind must make a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test or suffer a &ndash;10 penalty to both Intelligence and Willpower for [[/r 2d10 + 4]] hours. Only one dose may be administered at a time - additional doses have no effect. The @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.items.3wCtgMDNnu8MFmyk]{Immunity (Poison)} Trait renders this effect of Slowmind completely ineffective.</p>\n<p>A poultice made from this plant has an entirely separate effect &mdash; slathered on a fresh wound each dose immediately removes one @Condition[Bleeding] Condition. However, any more than one dose will require a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test to avoid the same negative effects caused by drinking an infusion of Slowmind, as above.&nbsp;</p>"
