There are few other names for the herb, although I have heard it called Emperor&rsquo;s Wort in some cities, often by Humans who came by the herb dishonestly and use a Human name in order to avoid the wrath of the authorities. For the best effect, the leaves should be boiled until they completely disintegrate; the mixture is then strained, boiled down to the consistency of melted cheese, and left to cool.</p>"

The Endurance Test made to @JournalEntry[Healing]{recover Wounds} that day is <strong>Very Easy (+60).</strong></p>\n<p>Applied to a blade, or more commonly an arrow head, too little of the Herb will be introduced to cause the deep sleep for which Tarrabeth is known. However, those wounded by such a weapon will still find themselves becoming terribly tired, and must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test or suffer one @Condition[Fatigued] Condition. A single dose of Tarrabeth can treat one weapon, or three arrows or bolts.</p>"
