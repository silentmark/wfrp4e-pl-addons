      "value": "<p>Having summoned and controlled a Daemonic Steed, you now touch and infuse the mount with <em>Dhar</em>. The Steed will then bear its rider and a single passenger beyond the mortal world and into the borders of the realm of Chaos, covering vast distances in mere minutes. Though the riders perceive the journey only dimly, the effects of witnessing such horrors are harrowing. The ride must be initiated within 2 Rounds of the spell being cast and will last @Roll[1d10] minutes. At the end of each minute, both riders must perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool </strong>Test or gain +1 Mental Corruption point. At the end of the ride, the riders must also perform a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance </strong>Test for a Moderate Corrupting Influence. Luckily, the speed and skill of the Steed protects the riders from closer contact with other denizens of the realm. Once the ride is finished, the Steed and its passengers will charge back into the material realm at the targeted destination, which must be within 100 miles of the journeyâ€™s beginning. It is rumoured that a more powerful version of this spell traverses closer to the heart of the Realm of Chaos, thereby covering much vaster distances in the material realm. But surely no such spell exists, for to travel so would be utter madness.</p>"
