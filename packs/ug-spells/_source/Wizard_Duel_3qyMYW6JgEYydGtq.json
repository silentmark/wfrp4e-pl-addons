The loser gains +1 Fatigued Condition; if the opposed SL exceeds their Willpower Bonus, they must pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test or take the Unconscious Condition. If a combatant takes more Fatigued Conditions than their Toughness Bonus, they suﬀer the Unconscious Condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The duel ends when either combatant takes an Unconscious Condition; an outsider interrupts either duellist, causing both duellists a Surprised Condition from the severed connection; or the winner of that Round decides to end the duel&mdash;immediately inflicting +1 Stunned Condition on the loser for each Round that you won.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Overcast: </strong>For every +1 SL, you may add 1 SL to the first Opposed Test if the Test is successful.&nbsp;</p>"
