The disease spread by your breath depends on the units die from your Casting roll: on 1-7, it&rsquo;s <em>Ratte Feve</em>r; on 8-0, it&rsquo;s <em>Black Plaque</em>. Choose a single target that you can see within half your Willpower yards (rounded up). That target becomes the centre of a circular Area of Eﬀect with a diameter equal to your Willpower Bonus yards. All creatures inside that AoE are struck, as are all creatures between you and the AoE. Perform an <strong>Opposed Channelling/Dodge</strong> Test against all aﬀected victims of the breath (using your single roll opposed by each individual target). All victims that lose the Test suﬀer a <em>magic missile</em> with a Damage of +4, ignoring Toughness Bonus and Armour Points. A target that suﬀers Wounds must pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test or contract the breath&rsquo;s disease. As with the <em>Breath</em> Creature Trait, you are immune to the spell&rsquo;s eﬀects.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overcast: For every +2 SL, you may make the Endurance Test more diﬃcult by one step (ie, from Challenging to Diﬃcult).&nbsp;</p>"
