      "value": "<p>You channel the filth of the Warp into a close water source, turning it into a vector for disease. The specific disease introduced into the water depends on the units die from your Casting roll: on 1-7, it&rsquo;s Ratte Fever; on 8-0, it&rsquo;s Black Plaque. Springs, ponds, wells, kegs and goblets are all common targets for this spell. Any source of contact at all with the diseased water requires the creature to pass an Easy (+40) Endurance Test or contract the disease. The GM should adjust the Diﬃculty based on the water source and the nature of contraction. A small vessel such as a cup, vial or pitcher makes the Test more diﬃcult by two steps (ie, Easy to Challenging). A medium vessel such as a very small pond, keg or barrel makes it more diﬃcult by one step. Similarly, drinking the water or bathing in it makes the Test more diﬃcult by two steps, while washing hands with it or rubbing it over the face would count as one step. A large body of water, such as a wide river, lake, or ocean will just dilute the disease from one spell, though rumour has it that Skaven Sorcerers will gather in large groups to infect larger bodies of water.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"
