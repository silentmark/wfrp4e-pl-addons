Its ferocity is such that it continues to gnaw until the target is no more. While the spell has many applications, <em>Gnaw</em> is often used for &lsquo;punching holes&rsquo; in wooden gates, earthworks, or palisades during sieges. The horde causes 2d10 Damage per Round to anything within the AoE, ignoring non-magical Armour Points (minimum of 1). However, the horde cannot chew through things that normal rats cannot destroy, such as solid stone or steel. Living creatures are allowed a <strong>Hard (-20) Dodge</strong> Test to avoid the onslaught. While the spell is active, you may use your Action to control the magical horde&rsquo;s location by passing an <strong>Average (+20) Channelling</strong> Test, allowing you to Move the targeted AoE at the Rats&rsquo; Walk or Run rate in any direction. Anything in the path suﬀers the Damage above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"
