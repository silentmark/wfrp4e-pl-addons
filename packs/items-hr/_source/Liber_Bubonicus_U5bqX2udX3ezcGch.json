Every disease created and every foul experiment is marked down and tracked, both their composition and their effect on the living.</p><p>Each of the different orders of Plague Monks keeps its own copy, updated daily by a Plague Priest. A Skaven who loses a copy of this sacred tome is cursed by the Horned Rat, and must roll on the @Table[wrath]{Wrath of the Gods} table every day until the book is recovered and those who stole it have been punished in a grisly ritual sacrifice.</p><p>By reading from a copy of the <em>Liber Bubonicus</em>, a Plague Priest or Plague Lord can cast any spell from the @UUID[JournalEntry.yGkrRqB7Cf0aiuCA.JournalEntryPage.Mn2r16uO3nJRhOzy#the-lore-of-plague]{Lore of Plague} as if from a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-horned-rat.items.HM1PLaF1y7ZfOPU5]{Warp Scroll}, with no Casting Test and no chance of a miscast or a critical. Each spell may be cast once per day.</p>"
