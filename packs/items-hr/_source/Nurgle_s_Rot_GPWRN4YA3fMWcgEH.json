      "value": "<p>The Plague Father has lent his name to only one disease, and it is the crowning glory of all his fetid works. Nurgle’s Rot is a terrible and contagious ailment which wracks the body, mind and even the soul of those who suffer from it. It is most commonly caught during encounters with powerful servants of Nurgle, though it has on occasion spread like wildfire through a village, town, or entire region, before vanishing. While those who suffer from it can only curse the Plague Lord’s name, the disease itself epitomises the ethos of Nurgle’s followers — that of enduring terrible suffering and emerging stronger for it. </p><table style=\"width: 100%; height: 85px;\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"width: 66.4153%; height: 17px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Source of Infection</strong></td><td style=\"width: 32.8621%; height: 17px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Difficulty</strong></td></tr><tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"width: 66.4153%; height: 17px;\">Mortal sufferer with at least two symptoms</td><td style=\"width: 32.8621%; height: 17px;\">Easy (+40)</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"width: 66.4153%; height: 17px;\">Nurgling, pool of Daemon bile</td><td style=\"width: 32.8621%; height: 17px;\">Average (+20)</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"width: 66.4153%; height: 17px;\">Plaguebearer, Blightking</td><td style=\"width: 32.8621%; height: 17px;\">Challenging (+0)</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"width: 66.4153%; height: 17px;\">Great Unclean One</td><td style=\"width: 32.8621%; height: 17px;\"><p>Difficult (-10)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Nurgle’s Rot presents differently in all who suffer from it. After incubation, the sufferer will appear jaundiced, with blotchy skin and yellow eyes. This has no negative effects, beyond marking them as ill in some way. One week after this occurs, and at the end of each week thereafter, the victim makes a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test. If they fail they develop a new symptom, as below. Where two options are given, the GM may choose whichever they prefer.</p><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>Add the symptoms chosen manually via the <strong>System Effects</strong> dropdown in the Effects tab of an Actor</p></blockquote><p><strong>First Failure</strong>: @Symptom[Coughs and Sneezes] or a @Symptom[Fever].</p><p><strong>Second Failure</strong>: @Symptom[Pox] or @Symptom[Malaise].</p><p><strong>Third Failure</strong>: @Symptom[Flux] or @Symptom[Nausea].</p><p><strong>Fourth Failure</strong>: @Symptom[Buboes] or @Symptom[Gangrene].</p><p><strong>Fifth Failure</strong>: @Symptom[Convulsions] or @Symptom[Wounded].</p><p><strong>Sixth Failure</strong>: @Symptom[Blight].</p><p><strong>Seventh Failure</strong>: Death. A new Plaguebearer is born.</p><p>A potential victim of Nurgle’s Rot may spend a Fate Point to avoid contracting it. However, once infected, it is impossible to rid oneself of Nurgle’s Rot. Fate Points spent after the victim is infected merely delay the onset of new symptoms by a month. Should a victim of Nurgle’s Rot die from the disease, a new Plaguebearer is created in the Realm of Chaos, emerging from a pustule of filth on a tree in Nurgle’s Garden. If the GM prefers, then a Plague Bearer might instead erupt forth from the body of the victim, should that prove the more dramatic option. </p>"
