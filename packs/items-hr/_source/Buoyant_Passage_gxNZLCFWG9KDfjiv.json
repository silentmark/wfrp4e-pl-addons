      "value": "<p>You become as buoyant as a piece of balsa wood, allowing you to tread over liquid surfaces like water, sewage, or oil as if they were solid ground. This spell also prevents tracks from forming in soft earth, snow, mud, or similar and any attempt to track you using such signs automatically fails.</p><p>\n\n <b>Lore:</b> <p>The Lore of Stealth draws on the power of <em>Dhar</em>, infused with a particularly large portion of <em>Ulgu</em>, to confuse and conceal. It is unclear whether this lore remains similar to how it is practised in Cathay, or if the Sorcerers of Clan Eshin have corrupted a more noble form of stealthy magic. Regardless, spells of this lore specialise in concealing the sorcerer from prying eyes, using magic to distract or diminish signs of the Skaven&rsquo;s presence.</p><p>The Lore of Stealth wreathes the wielder in threads of magic that obfuscate their presence. Whenever you successfully cast a spell from the Lore of Stealth, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.OzwDT6kzoLYeeR2d]{Stealthy} Creature Trait for [[/br 1d10]] rounds.</p><p>Ingredients: Clan Eshin Sorcerers use small scraps of paper with assorted runes inscribed on them, which are then coated in powdered Warpstone. When used as an ingredient, the Warpstone powder is consumed, but the scraps of paper remain and can be coated again and reused. The characters used are of no known form of written Queekish, and the Sorcerers of Clan Eshin are in no rush to explain either their meaning or providence.</p><p>"
