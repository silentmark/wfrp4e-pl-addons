If targeting an unwilling target, resolve the touch attempt using the rules for casting a touch spell in combat (see @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.YBVrpUHEjohB1H4f.JournalEntryPage.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR]{Magic Rules}), and the victim may make a <strong>Difficult (&ndash;10) Cool</strong> Test to change their destination by +SL yards. The target must be Average size or smaller. You must be able to see the destination, and this location must be free of objects and creatures or the spell fails.</p><p>\n\n <b>Lore:</b> <p>The Lore of Stealth draws on the power of <em>Dhar</em>, infused with a particularly large portion of <em>Ulgu</em>, to confuse and conceal. It is unclear whether this lore remains similar to how it is practised in Cathay, or if the Sorcerers of Clan Eshin have corrupted a more noble form of stealthy magic. Regardless, spells of this lore specialise in concealing the sorcerer from prying eyes, using magic to distract or diminish signs of the Skaven&rsquo;s presence.</p><p>The Lore of Stealth wreathes the wielder in threads of magic that obfuscate their presence. Whenever you successfully cast a spell from the Lore of Stealth, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.OzwDT6kzoLYeeR2d]{Stealthy} Creature Trait for [[/br 1d10]] rounds.</p><p>Ingredients: Clan Eshin Sorcerers use small scraps of paper with assorted runes inscribed on them, which are then coated in powdered Warpstone. When used as an ingredient, the Warpstone powder is consumed, but the scraps of paper remain and can be coated again and reused. The characters used are of no known form of written Queekish, and the Sorcerers of Clan Eshin are in no rush to explain either their meaning or providence.</p><p>"
