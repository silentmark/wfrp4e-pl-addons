      "value": "<p>You summon a swarm of rats that appear next to you and move as you direct, attacking any creature (except you) they encounter. You do not need to spend your action directing the swarm &mdash; it responds to any squeaked command readily. However, after Willpower Bonus rounds have elapsed, you lose control of the swarm. Thereafter, it moves about at random, attacking any creature it encounters.</p>\n<p>If the rat swarm encounters a creature, the rats scurry across its lower extremities biting and scratching furiously, inflicting [[/r 1d10 #Wounds]] Wounds to each non-prosthetic leg a creature has. This Damage is reduced by Toughness Bonus, but not armour (the rats scuttle inside of clothing and armour with alarming skill). The rats climb over any object less than 1 yard tall to reach their victims.</p>\n<p>The swarm can be destroyed by any area of effect attack, but is immune to regular attacks &mdash; a sword blow or stomped boot will kill a rat or two, but more emerge to take their place. While not under the direct control of the caster, the swarm will not attack victims wielding a torch or other sizable open flame if another target is available, and will avoid targets inflicted with an @Condition[Ablaze] Condition entirely.</p>\n<p>After the spell ends, the rats disperse.</p><p>\n\n <b>Lore:</b> <p>The Lore of Plague draws its power from rot and decay, focusing raw <em>Dhar </em>into more refined forms of disease and corruption. Its spells corrupt all that they touch, and indeed few become proficient in the Lore of Plague without bearing some of its marks. Most Plague-Priests are covered in sores and pustules: glorious stigmata and a sign of their mastery over the forces of entropy.</p><p>The Lore of Plague infuses the wielder with the essence of rot. Whenever you successfully cast a spell from the Lore of Plague, you may gain the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.MVI0lXcg6vvtooAF]{Distracting} Creature Trait for the next [[/br 1d10]] rounds.</p><p>Ingredients: Plague-Priests use all manner of vile excreta, odious emissions, and corrupted objects as spell ingredients. Most are squirted into the air and ritually inhaled, or burned inside a Plague Censer.</p><p>"
