It flourishes especially in graveyards, which, together with its well-known magical properties, has led some people to theorise that it somehow feeds on the magical energies of the bodies buried beneath it. The root, when dried and grated, may be used in a number of preparations and magical spells concerning the Undead, and it actually seems to affect them as poison would affect a living creature. An infusion of the root seems to have no particular effect on a living patient, except to cause vomiting at higher concentrations. Less well known is the fact that a hot poultice made from both the leaves and root of this plant speeds the healing of infected wounds caused by undead creatures.</p>"
