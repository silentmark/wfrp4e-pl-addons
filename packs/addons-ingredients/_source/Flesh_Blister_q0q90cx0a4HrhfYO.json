The very touch of this poison is enough to make flesh blister and melt away, and consuming even a dose is almost always lethal.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: serif\">A treated weapon must be used within the hour or the poison will evaporate harmlessly. Blades coated with this venom take on a dappled greenish hue that rarely fades, marking their wielders as extremely untrustworthy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: serif\">A weapon coated in Flesh Blister which inflicts at least 1 Wound automatically inflicts an additional 1d10 Wounds. Anyone unfortunate enough to consume Flesh Blister in any form must make a Hard (-20) Endurance Test or suffer an immediate Critical Hit to the torso.</span></p>"
