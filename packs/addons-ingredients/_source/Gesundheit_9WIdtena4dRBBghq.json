The Elves call it <em>Leoleghas</em>, and in Bretonnia it is known as <em>Feuille de Blessure</em>. In the Moot, we call it &lsquo;Heal-All&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>It is a very simple herb to use: simply bruise the leaves to release their sap, and create a poultice. There are some who like to add various other healing herbs, according to the nature of the wound or the source of the infection, but I have never found this necessary.</p>"
