For six hours after consuming a dose of Wheeze, the victim becomes extremely easy to fatigue. Even minor tasks should as climbing a ladder or taking a short walk become extremely tiring for even fit individuals. Any task involving even a little physical stimulation causes the victim to gain a Fatigued Condition. Any activity which would normally inflict a Fatigued Condition inflicts two instead.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: serif\"> At the end of each hour, the victim may attempt a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test to shake off this effect. If they pass they no longer gain Fatigued Conditions solely due to the effects of the poison â€” however, any Fatigued Conditions they already had remain until they have rested.</span></p>"
