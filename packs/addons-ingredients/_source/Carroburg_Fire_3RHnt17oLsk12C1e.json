Many alternative explanations were generated, from their having swallowed a small dragon to having consumed a pint of dragon's blood.</p><p>One particularly credulous alchemist took this latter suggestion at face value, and set about recreating the potion that was supposedly used to achieve this. To the surprise of almost everyone save the rather self assured alchemist herself, the result was a potion which allowed the brave to — very briefly, and at great person risk — breath fire.</p><p><span style=\"font-family: serif\">After consuming the potion, the imbiber gains the Breath +10 (Fire) Creature Trait. (WFRP page 338) They may activate this trait once without spending any advantage to do so, after which the effects of the potion end. Immediately after making breathing fire, the user must make a Hard (-20) Endurance Test. If they fail, they gain an Ablaze Condition.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: serif\">Given the potion's cost and substantial drawbacks, the Fire-breathers of Carroburg continue to rely on their tried and true methods during their performances.</span></p></div></div>"
