Growing in woodlands and flowering before the trees put on enough leaf to block sunlight from the forest floor, the sap of this plant can also be used to help restore feeling to the skin in cases of numbness caused by cold or injury. On one occasion, I used it in a concentrated form &mdash; boiled until it reached the consistency of hot custard &mdash; as a treatment for frostbite, and was able to restore feeling to a foot which otherwise might have had to be amputated. Because of the itching it causes, you may sometimes need to administer a mild sedative to the patient, especially if you use Juck repeatedly, or over a large area such as an entire leg.</p>"

[[/r 1d10]] minutes after being smeared with the juice of the plant&rsquo;s leaves, the treated area begins to itch horribly, and the afflicted Character suffers a -20 penalty to all Tests for [[/r 2d10 + 40]] minutes owing to the distraction and the terrible need to scratch. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Willpower</strong> Test may be made to ignore the itching for 10 minutes: each SL reduces the penalty by 10, totally negating the penalty with 2 or more SLs.</p>\n<p>A more useful, if less common use for Juck is as a treatment for frostbite. An application of a poultice containing Juck to the damaged extremities can help to speed up healing. One dose of Juck will heal [[/r 1d10]] wounds lost to the effects of @JournalEntry[Other Damage]{Exposure} to cold weather. This treatment can be repeated daily.</p>"
